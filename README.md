# Mini Paint Application

A simplified online painting application that allows users to create pixel art in the browser with basic tools such as a pencil, eraser, and color picker. Users can draw on a grid-based canvas and save their work locally.

## Features
- **Tools**: Pencil for free drawing, eraser with multiple sizes, and color picker.
- **Save and Reset**: Save the artwork locally or reset the canvas.
- **Canvas**: A pixel grid-based canvas where each cell represents a pixel.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts for tablet and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular**: Framework for the application.
- **Material Icons**: For the tool icons (pencil, eraser, etc.).
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For drawing functionality.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for responsiveness and tool design.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and clear structure.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `ng serve`.
4. Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

## Best Practices
- **Component-Based Design**: Separate concerns with clear component structure.
- **Responsive UI**: Flexible grid layout for different device sizes.
- **Type Safety**: Use of TypeScript for better maintainability.
